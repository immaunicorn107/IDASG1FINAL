        <h2>About Le Sserafim</h2>
        <p>LE SSERAFIM is a girl group with SOURCE MUSIC, a label under HYBE, consisting of five members of different
            nationalities:</p>
        <p>SAKURA, KIM CHAEWON, HUH YUNJIN, KAZUHA and HONG EUNCHAE. The first girl group to launch through a
            collaboration
            between HYBE and SOURCE MUSIC, they are taking a daring stance and saying right from the outset that they
            will stand at the very
            top. The group's name, LE SSERAFIM, is an anagram of the words "I'M FEARLESS." The name captures the group's
            self-confidence
            and iron will as they go out into the world fearlessly and unwavering before the watchful eyes of the world.
            It is like an incantation to
            guarantee their success on the merit of their unbreakable poise and strength. </p>

                    <p>LE SSERAFIM releases their first studio album entitled UNFORGIVEN, boldly paving their own path!
                        LE SSERAFIM’s first studio album one year into their debut, collaborating with a world-class
                        musician!
                        “We don’t care what other people think.” Lead single “UNFORGIVEN (feat. Nile Rodgers)”</p>

                    <p>LE SSERAFIM’s first studio album entitled UNFORGIVEN is released on May 1.
                        LE SSERAFIM (KIM CHAEWON, SAKURA, HUH YUNJIN, KAZUHA, HONG EUNCHAE) told stories as only they
                        could through their two mini albums FEARLESS and ANTIFRAGILE that were released last year.</p>

                    <p>The members candidly expressed their desires to become the best in FEARLESS, and resolved to grow
                        and become even stronger as they encounter hardships in ANTIFRAGILE. In their first studio album
                        UNFORGIVEN, they portray their will to pave their own way, paying no mind to what others think.
                        The five members declare that they will march ahead in the direction they see fit, freeing
                        themselves from others’ standards in song.</p>

                <p>Type: EP</p>
                <p>Release Date: 17 OCT 2022</p>
                <div class="read-more" style="display: none;">
                    <p>“We Can’t Be Broken”: How LE SSERAFIM Faces Adversities</p>
                    <P>LE SSERAFIM is back, and they’re raising their voices louder and stronger than ever to stand up
                        against everything life can throw at them.
                        The group’s new album opens with their infallibility guarantee, “The Hydra,” followed by the
                        title
                        track, “ANTIFRAGILE,” that reveals the kind of strength of character that lets them repurpose
                        hardship as an impetus for growth.</p>

                    <p>Midway through the mini album, “Impurities” shows that the girls embrace everything about
                        themselves,
                        wounds and all, while “No Celestial” signals their intention to shed away images of angel wings
                        in
                        favor of living a down-to-earth life like everyone else. Rounding off their sophomore release is
                        “Good Parts (where the quality is bad but I am),” an ode to the imperfect, sometimes pedestrian
                        traits that make up a part of who we all are.</p>

                    <p>Equally impressive is the album cover, a visual representation of the messages explored
                        throughout
                        ANTIFRAGILE.
                        The design features gold crevices running across a black background, a nod to kintsugi art and
                        its
                        method of accepting the imperfections of broken ceramics by preserving the telltale signs of
                        their
                        fragility. Outside forces bent on breaking the mind are ultimately no match for the members of
                        LE
                        SSERAFIM, who will continue to hold each other up until they become an even better version of
                        themselves.</p>

                <p>Type: EP</p>
                <p>Release Date: 02 MAY 2022</p>
                <div class="read-more" style="display: none;">
                    <p>FEARLESS, the debut album from LE SSERAFIM, the group courageously singing out to the world
                        Join a group of girls following their hearts as they set out on a journey never undertaken by
                        anyone before</p>

                    <p>LE SSERAFIM's FEARLESS tells the story of a group of girls whose dream of reaching the top leads
                        them on a never-before-undertaken journey.</p>

                    <p>As the world looks toward LE SSERAFIM’s debut, the group stands up against their expectations
                        rather than bowing down before them.
                        They say the worst thing you can do is to get tied up in the past and lose yourself, but the
                        most valuable thing is to stay true to yourself and pursue your dreams. As they set out for new
                        horizons, LE SSERAFIM couldn’t care less about the way the world sees them.
                        They choose the future, not the past; not to sink, but to soar.</p>

                    <p>There are five songs on the album: “The World Is My Oyster,” which serves as an introduction to
                        the album as the girls sing of their ambition to do things their way in three different
                        languages; the title song, “FEARLESS”; “Blue Flame,” which uses fascinating blue fireflies as a
                        symbol of a desire to set out on an adventure into the unknown; a reinterpretation of The Little
                        Mermaid through the eyes LE SSERAFIM in “The Great Mermaid”; and “Sour Grapes,” a song about
                        naive yet selfish attitude toward love and based on Aesop’s fable The Fox and the Grapes.</p>
